# Stahp Sn3k!
Just an experiment using Pyglet as a python interface to OpenGL used to build
a 3D version of the classic snake game. In addition, this serves as an
experiemental playground for networking, which I've not done a lot of.

# Multiplayer
This game has multiplayer over a network and has no security measures.

# Todo
- Synchronize food by having the server generate and send it
- Some form of "battle" or competition
- A FPS display
- A length display

# Bugs
- Server seems to crash when >= 4 clients connect and start moving around
